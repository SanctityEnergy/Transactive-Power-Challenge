# Transactive Power Challenge
CL+B Fest Challenge

**Teams participating in the Legal Hackers 2018 [Computational Law and Blockchain Festival](https://legalhackers.org/clbfest2018) are encouraged to tackle the [Transactive Power Challenge](https://sanctityenergy.github.io/TransactivePowerChallenge/) with a high level design concept and rapid prototype project:**

## The Purpose

Our energy systems are in a precarious state, whilst modern society grows increasingly dependent upon electricity. With the emergence of renewable energy resources, smart-grids and microgrids we are at an inflection point in our energy history. The entire industry is poised for massive change. Let's put our heads together to think about how we can use blockcahin technology to streamline issues that currently exist in the energy space. 

The goal of this challenge is for teams to develop a conceptual design and rapid prototype that demonstrates how individuals/companies can use blockchain technology to facilitate 1) renewable energy integration and distribution or 2) transactions on a smart grid.  

## Conceptual Design
The conceptual design should include an outline or sketch of a realistic approach to deployment and stable operation of the energy system, including a:
* Business model;
* Legal framework; and
* Technology architecture

## Rapid Prototype 

The rapid prototype should demonstrate how the energy system enables individuals/companies to facilitate legally valid trading and distribution of electricity across regions, such as: 

* Transfering energy between parties within a micro-grid;
* Sending and receiving electricity across regional operators;
* Intregrating renewable energy resources to a decentralized grid; and
* Securitize transactions among users and owners on a grid

# Criteria and Judging

Teams are expected to:

* Pitch their project idea at or before the start of the 2018 CL+B Fest through a 2 minute or shorter video clip uploaded to YouTube under Creative Commons license;
* Present their final project in a 2 minute or shorter video clip uploaded to YouTube under Creative Commons license;
* Provide their final project materials (including any slides, video and other media, documentation, working code, etc) through a GitHub repository under an open source license.

Final team projects will be reviewed and rated by a panel of invited judges.  Evaluation criteria will be added to this challenge page after an initial meeting of the judges and prior to the start of the CL+B Festival event.  The top team projects will be determined based on rank order resulting from an aggregate of the ratings by each judge.

# Prize

The team submitting the top ranked, highest rated project will receive the following:
* Opportunity to work with judges and present the project in-person at MIT to interested students, faculty and researchers
* (more prizes to be added)

More information on challenge criteria and additional prizes and awards will be added to this challenge page as they are finalized.
