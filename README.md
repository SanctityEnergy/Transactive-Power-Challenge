# Transactive Power Challenge
CL+B Fest Challenge

The Transactive Power Challenge is presented by Sanctity Energy, and there will be a **$500 cash prize** and opportunity to work with judges and **present the project in-person at MIT** to interested students, faculty and researchers for the winning team.

## The Purpose

Modern society is growing increasingly dependent upon electricity while our energy systems remain in a precarious state. With the emergence of renewable energy resources, smart-grids and microgrids we stand at an inflection point in our energy history. The entire industry is poised for massive change. Let's put our heads together to think about how we can use blockchain technology to streamline issues that currently exist in the energy space. 

This challenge aims to develop a conceptual design and rapid prototype that demonstrates how individuals/companies can use blockchain technology to facilitate:

1) renewable energy integration and distribution, or

2) data transactions on a smart grid.  

**Teams participating in the Legal Hackers 2018 [Computational Law and Blockchain Festival](https://legalhackers.org/clbfest2018) are encouraged to tackle the [Transactive Power Challenge](https://sanctityenergy.github.io/TransactivePowerChallenge/) with a high level design concept and rapid prototype project:**

## Conceptual Design
The conceptual design should include an outline or sketch of a realistic approach to deployment and stable operation of the energy system, including a:

* Business model;
* Legal framework (privacy, transaction, right to be forgotten); and
* Technology architecture

For example, teams submitting a blockchain-based energy management system (potentially based on the ideas of distributed energy generation, transactive grids, etc.) must champion the design, implementation and deployment, and demonstrate how the system can be secure.

## Rapid Prototype 

The rapid prototype should demonstrate the transaction process in the energy system that enables individuals/companies to either:

1) facilitate legally valid integration and distribution in security regions, such as: 

  * Transfering energy between parties within a micro-grid;
  * Sending and receiving electricity across other operators; and 
  * Integrating renewable energy resources to a decentralized grid; or

2) securing data on a smart grid, such as:

  * Securitizing transactions among users and owners on a grid;
  * Providing hardware identity to IoT Devices on a smartgrid (for smart contract execution); and
  * Protecting data for smart meters, renewable energy generation, etc.

# Criteria and Judging

Teams are expected to:

* Pitch their project idea at or before the start of the 2018 CL+B Fest through a 2-minute or shorter video clip uploaded to YouTube under Creative Commons license;
* Present their final project in a 2-minute or shorter video clip uploaded to YouTube under Creative Commons license;
* Provide their final project materials (including any slides, video and other media, documentation, working code, etc.) through a GitHub repository under a permissive open source license.

Final team projects will be reviewed and rated by a panel of invited judges.  Evaluation criteria will be added to this challenge page after an initial meeting of the judges and prior to the start of the CL+B Festival event. The top team projects will be determined based on rank order resulting from an aggregate of the ratings by each judge.

# Prize

The team submitting the top-ranked, highest-rated project will receive the following:
* Opportunity to work with judges and present the project in-person at MIT to interested students, faculty and researchers
* $500 Cash Prize
