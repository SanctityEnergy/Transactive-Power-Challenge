# Transactive Power Challenge
CL+B Fest Challenge

**Teams participating in the Legal Hackers 2018 [Computational Law and Blockchain Festival](https://legalhackers.org/clbfest2018) are encouraged to tackle the [Transactive Power Challenge](https://sanctityenergy.github.io/TransactivePowerChallenge/) with a high level design concept and rapid prototype project:**

## Conceptual Design

Develop a conceptual design and rapid prototype demonstrating how individuals/companies can use blockchain technology for energy distribution and trading on a transactive grid.  

The conceptual design should include an outline or sketch of a realistic approach to deployment and stable operation of the energy system, including a:
* Business model;
* Legal framework; and
* Technology architecture

## Rapid Prototype 

The rapid prototype should demonstrate how the energy system enables individuals/companies to facilitate legally valid trading and distribution of electricity across regions, such as: 

* Transfering energy between parties within a micro-grid;
* Sending and receiving electricity across regional operators;
* Intregrating renewable energy resources to a decentralized grid; and
* Securitize transactions among users and owners on a grid

# Team Participation

To register your team project for the Transactive Power Challenge, submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/SanctityEnergy/TransactivePowerChallenge/issues/new) with the following information: 
* The name of your project and your team name;
* The names of your team members including the GitHub username of at least one member;
* The URL of the GitHub repository where your project will be developed and submitted;
* The URL of the YouTube Channel where your team will submit video; and
* The name and URL of the Festival Node your team is participating in

# Criteria and Judging

Teams are expected to:

* Pitch their project idea at or before the start of the 2018 CL+B Fest through a 2 minute or shorter video clip uploaded to YouTube under Creative Commons license;
* Present their final project in a 2 minute or shorter video clip uploaded to YouTube under Creative Commons license;
* Provide their final project materials (including any slides, video and other media, documentation, working code, etc) through a GitHub repository under an open source license.

Final team projects will be reviewed and rated by a panel of invited judges.  Evaluation criteria will be added to this challenge page after an initial meeting of the judges and prior to the start of the CL+B Festival event.  The top team projects will be determined based on rank order resulting from an aggregate of the ratings by each judge.  The team submitting the top ranked, highest rated project will be invited to present the project in-person at MIT to interested students, faculty and researchers.  

More information on challenge criteria and additional prizes and awards will be added to this challenge page as they are finalized.

# Live Hangout

We'll provide an overview of the Transactive Energy Challenge and go over questions about how to submit a team project during this live Google Hangout on Friday, February 15th at 8:00 PM Eastern / 5:00 PM Pacific:
